It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. 
You can even [link to Lascon's program!](http://sisne.org/lascon-vii/program/?lang=en)


# This is a section heading
## This is a sub-section heading
###### This is a 6th order section heading

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_
